        <P>Cooking is all about people. Food is maybe the only universal thing that really has the power to bring

                <h1>Kabab</h1>
                <p>Kebabs are great for either a casual dinner party or a weeknight meal with the family. They help you
                    stretch a small amount of meat, poultry, or fish over more servings by threading on lots of colorful
                    vegetables. And, perhaps best of all, theyâ€™re just fun to eat. For foolproof kebab success,</p>
